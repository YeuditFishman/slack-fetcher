# Export Slack Users

This project retrieves Slack users from a workspace using the Slack API and
 saves them in a JSON file. The project is stored in a Docker container and
 uses environment variables for configuration.

## Files

### Source (/src)

**main.py** : The main entry point. Connects to Slack using the token and API address
from environment variables, retrieves users, and saves them in a JSON file.

### Tests (/test)

Unit tests are written using unittest with mocked Slack API calls to ensure reliable,
 isolated testing of data processing and file persistence logic.

## Usage

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t slack-app .
```

2. Run the application:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env slack-app
```
